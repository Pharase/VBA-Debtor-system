## ⚙️ How It Works (Overview)

1. **Start the automation**  
   Run `Run_Payment.bat` to kick off the entire process.

2. **Email attachment download & preprocessing**  
   - Automatically saves attached payment files from email.
   - Compares new data with existing summary to extract only **new payment records**.

3. **Trigger payment generation (Excel)**  
   - Opens `payment.xlsm` to generate a file used by the main VBA program.

4. **Transaction recording in UI system**  
   - Launch `trans_program17_4.xlsm`, which includes a VBA-based **User Interface (UI)**.
     - ✅ Press **"Load Payment Info"** to import data.
     - 📝 Press **"Update Value"** to record payment history into each debtor’s card file.
     - 🧾 Press **"Update Datadaily"** to export the latest record to a daily template.
   - File automatically closes once done.

5. **Generate summary & send report**  
   - Run `Run_Summary.bat` to:
     - Generate final summary file.
     - Attach specific files.
     - Send summary via **email**.
